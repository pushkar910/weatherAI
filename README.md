# 🌦️ WeatherAI  

WeatherAI is a lightweight AI agent that leverages the **DeepSeek Large Language Model (LLM)** running locally and integrates seamlessly with **Spring Boot**. This project demonstrates how to utilize local LLMs with function-calling capabilities to fetch real-time data, eliminating the need for paid hosted LLMs like OpenAI.  

## 🚀 Features  

✅ **Local AI Processing** – Runs the DeepSeek LLM entirely on your local machine, ensuring data privacy and reducing latency.  
✅ **Spring Boot Integration** – Combines the robustness of Spring Boot with advanced AI capabilities.  
✅ **Function Calling** – Implements function-calling mechanisms to retrieve real-time weather data and more.
